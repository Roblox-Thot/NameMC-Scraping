## Info
Every file starts with the tag then ends with the type.

Skins are the path of the NameMC skin so for example "/skin/923222f41f42bf20" would be the URL "https://namemc.com/skin/923222f41f42bf20"

Users contains usernames that have used a skin for the tag.

Just because a user is in a tag doesn't mean they are still wearing a skin with that tag.
